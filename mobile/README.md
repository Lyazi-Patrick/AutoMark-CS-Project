# AutoMark – Smart Grading Assistant 📱

AutoMark is a mobile and web-based system designed to help educators automatically grade student exam scripts using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and RESTful APIs. It allows scripts to be scanned, answers extracted and compared against an answer key, with logic-based scoring, grading, and optional manual override. It also integrates payment handling via MTN Mobile Money API for advanced features.

## 🌐 Backend & API Integration

### ✅ MTN Mobile Money API

We integrate the *MTN Mobile Money Open API* to handle secure payments inside the app. Users (lecturers/institutions) can:

- Access downloadable student reports
- Enable long-term script storage or printing services

> Authentication tokens and callbacks are managed securely, and all requests follow standard RESTful architecture.
